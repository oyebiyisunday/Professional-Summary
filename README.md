Results-driven Cloud & Data Engineer (AWS-Certified) with 5+ years designing cloud-native platforms, high-throughput data pipelines, and AI-powered analytics across AWS and Azure. I turn complex, high-volume datasets into reliable, real-time insights that improve decisions and move the needle.

Highlights: cut processing times by 40% with scalable architectures; lowered operational costs 25% via optimized ETL; improved forecasting accuracy 30% using predictive models; and lifted sales conversion 15% with live BI dashboards.

I build with Python, SQL, Terraform, Docker/Kubernetes, AWS Glue and Azure Data Factory, and integrate with SAP ERP. My focus: secure, highly available, cost-efficient systems that are observable, testable, and easy to evolve.

If your teams need faster pipelines, clearer analytics, and measurable outcomes, let‚Äôs talk.
